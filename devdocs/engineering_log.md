# Engineering Log

## 2025-09-18
- **Project configuration** – Confirmed the Godot `project.godot` autoload section still registers the `RNGManager`, `NameGenerator`, and `RNGProcessor` singletons required by the Platform GUI workflows.
- **Platform GUI validation** – Unable to launch the scene because the `godot4` executable is not present in the current environment; no runtime verification of the Generators, Seeds, or Debug Logs tabs was possible. Downstream tasks will need a workstation with Godot 4.4 installed to complete the handbook walkthrough.
- **Follow-up actions** – Once Godot 4.4 is available, re-run the Platform GUI workflow to confirm UI behaviour matches `devdocs/platform_gui_handbook.md`, paying particular attention to DebugRNG recording options.

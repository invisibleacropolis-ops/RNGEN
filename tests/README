# Test Harness

The project ships standalone headless scenarios alongside the manifest runner.
To execute the RNG processor integration suite directly, run:

```
godot --headless --script res://tests/test_rng_processor_headless.gd
```

Invoke the command from the project root so Godot can resolve the resource
paths declared in the test script.

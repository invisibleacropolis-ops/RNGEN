# Test Harness

The project ships standalone headless scenarios alongside the manifest runner.

## Grouped manifest runners

Execute each manifest group from `tests/tests_manifest.json` as separate commands so CI logs remain focused:

```
godot --headless --script res://tests/run_generator_tests.gd
godot --headless --script res://tests/run_platform_gui_tests.gd
godot --headless --script res://tests/run_diagnostics_tests.gd
```

Each script prints suite-level results for its group, streams log output as scenarios progress, and concludes with an aggregate summary and failure digest. The Platform GUI command covers controller integrations and the `Main_Interface` scene, while the diagnostics command replays curated manifest checks.

## Focused scenarios

To execute the RNG processor integration suite directly, run:

```
godot --headless --script res://tests/test_rng_processor_headless.gd
```

Invoke the command from the project root so Godot can resolve the resource
paths declared in the test script.

For an individual diagnostic registered in the manifest, call the diagnostic runner with the desired ID:

```
godot --headless --script res://tests/run_script_diagnostic.gd --diagnostic-id wordlist_strategy
```
